# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Eliminate pricing calculation errors through automated tiered pricing engine
- Prevent revenue leakage by implementing mandatory shift-to-shift reconciliation
- Enable accurate profitability tracking through FIFO inventory management
- Provide operational visibility through comprehensive reporting suite (10 MVP reports)
- Support mobile-first operations with tablet-optimized interface
- Deliver production-ready system in 12 weeks using single-phase integrated development

## Background Context

Thailand's cannabis dispensaries face unique operational challenges due to specialized product handling requirements and regulatory compliance needs. Current manual processes result in significant operational inefficiencies and revenue loss.

As documented in the Project Brief, these manual processes result in:
- **3-8% inventory shrinkage** due to lack of shift-to-shift reconciliation and accountability gaps
- **15-20% pricing calculation errors** from manual tiered pricing based on total flower weight
- **Inability to track profitability** due to lack of FIFO cost basis for inventory valuation
- **Limited operational visibility** without standardized reporting on sales, inventory, and employee performance

This PRD delivers an integrated POS solution that addresses these critical pain points through automated tiered pricing, mandatory shift reconciliation, FIFO inventory allocation, tare weight handling for accurate flower product measurement, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. The system will be built using modern web technologies (React, shadcn/ui, Supabase) with a mobile-first approach to support tablet-based operations in retail environments.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

The following features are intentionally out of scope for MVP but planned for future iterations:

- **Loyalty Programs**: Customer points, rewards, discount codes
- **Promotions & Bundle Pricing**: BOGO offers, time-based discounts, seasonal pricing
- **Thai Language Support**: Full UI translation to Thai for local staff
- **Customer-Facing Display**: Secondary screen showing cart and totals to customers
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive inventory, demand forecasting, ABC analysis
- **Employee Scheduling**: Shift planning, time tracking, labor cost management
- **Multi-Currency Support**: USD, EUR for tourist-heavy locations
- **E-Commerce Integration**: Online ordering, delivery coordination, pickup notifications
- **Supplier Management**: Purchase orders, supplier performance tracking
- **Customer Accounts**: Member profiles, purchase history, personalized recommendations
