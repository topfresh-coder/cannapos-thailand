# Cannabis Dispensary POS System - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Eliminate pricing calculation errors through automated tiered pricing engine
- Prevent revenue leakage by implementing mandatory shift-to-shift reconciliation
- Enable accurate profitability tracking through FIFO inventory management
- Provide operational visibility through comprehensive reporting suite (10 MVP reports)
- Support mobile-first operations with tablet-optimized interface
- Deliver production-ready system in 12 weeks using single-phase integrated development

### Background Context

Thailand's cannabis dispensaries face unique operational challenges due to specialized product handling requirements and regulatory compliance needs. Current manual processes result in significant operational inefficiencies and revenue loss.

As documented in the Project Brief, these manual processes result in:
- **3-8% inventory shrinkage** due to lack of shift-to-shift reconciliation and accountability gaps
- **15-20% pricing calculation errors** from manual tiered pricing based on total flower weight
- **Inability to track profitability** due to lack of FIFO cost basis for inventory valuation
- **Limited operational visibility** without standardized reporting on sales, inventory, and employee performance

This PRD delivers an integrated POS solution that addresses these critical pain points through automated tiered pricing, mandatory shift reconciliation, FIFO inventory allocation, tare weight handling for accurate flower product measurement, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. The system will be built using modern web technologies (React, shadcn/ui, Supabase) with a mobile-first approach to support tablet-based operations in retail environments.

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

The following features are intentionally out of scope for MVP but planned for future iterations:

- **Loyalty Programs**: Customer points, rewards, discount codes
- **Promotions & Bundle Pricing**: BOGO offers, time-based discounts, seasonal pricing
- **Thai Language Support**: Full UI translation to Thai for local staff
- **Customer-Facing Display**: Secondary screen showing cart and totals to customers
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive inventory, demand forecasting, ABC analysis
- **Employee Scheduling**: Shift planning, time tracking, labor cost management
- **Multi-Currency Support**: USD, EUR for tourist-heavy locations
- **E-Commerce Integration**: Online ordering, delivery coordination, pickup notifications
- **Supplier Management**: Purchase orders, supplier performance tracking
- **Customer Accounts**: Member profiles, purchase history, personalized recommendations

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The POS system allows cashiers to search for products by name or SKU with real-time filtering.

**FR2**: Products can be added to a shopping cart with quantity selection (supports decimals for weight-based items like flower).

**FR3**: The cart displays all items with: product name, quantity, unit price, line total, and running subtotal.

**FR4**: For flower products, the system calculates tiered pricing based on total flower weight in cart, automatically applying the appropriate price per gram from the pricing tiers table.

**FR5**: The tier pricing indicator displays current tier, price per gram, and weight range in the cart.

**FR6**: The system shows how much more weight is needed to reach the next tier with estimated savings.

**FR7**: Cashiers can adjust quantities and remove items from the cart with real-time price recalculation.

**FR8**: For flower products requiring tare weight, a modal prompts for gross weight and tare weight, calculating net weight automatically (net = gross - tare).

**FR9**: Checkout creates a transaction record with all items, totals, payment method, timestamp, and assigns to currently active shift.

**FR10**: Receipts display transaction details including: items, quantities, prices (with tier information for flower), totals, cashier name, location, timestamp.

**FR11**: Store managers can configure pricing tiers with: tier name, min/max weight ranges, price per gram.

**FR12**: The system validates tier ranges to prevent overlaps and ensure no gaps in coverage.

**FR13**: Managers can override prices on individual cart items with authorization and mandatory reason documentation.

**FR14**: Users authenticate via email and password using Supabase Auth with session management.

**FR15**: Cashiers must open their shift by entering starting cash float before POS access is granted.

**FR16**: Only one shift can be open per location at a time; previous shift must be closed before opening new shift.

**FR17**: All transactions are automatically assigned to the currently active shift.

**FR18**: Cashiers close shifts by entering actual cash count; system calculates variance (actual - expected).

**FR19**: Shifts with variance >à¸¿50 require mandatory variance reason entry.

**FR20**: Shift closures require manager approval before shift is finalized.

**FR21**: Managers can review pending shift reconciliations with full transaction history drilldown.

**FR22**: Managers can force-close shifts left open >24 hours with override documentation.

**FR23**: Cashiers can leave handoff notes for the next shift during shift close.

**FR24**: Store managers can create new products with: SKU, name, category, unit, base price, tare weight requirement flag.

**FR25**: Products can be edited (except SKU) and soft-deleted (marked inactive rather than hard delete).

**FR26**: Product detail view displays all associated batches with: batch number, received date, quantity received, quantity remaining, cost per unit, status.

**FR27**: Store managers can receive new product batches with: quantity, cost per unit, received date; batch numbers auto-generated.

**FR28**: The product catalog displays total available quantity across all active batches.

**FR29**: Products with available quantity below reorder threshold display low stock warnings.

**FR30**: Out-of-stock products (quantity = 0) are visually flagged and cannot be added to cart.

**FR31**: When transactions are completed, inventory is allocated from batches using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) based on received_date ascending.

**FR32**: If a single batch has sufficient quantity, full allocation comes from that batch; otherwise quantity is split across multiple batches in FIFO order.

**FR33**: Transaction items store batch allocation details in JSONB field: batch_id, quantity_allocated, cost_per_unit.

**FR34**: Tare weight values (gross, tare, net) are stored in transaction items for audit trail.

**FR35**: Batches are automatically marked as "Depleted" when quantity_remaining reaches zero.

**FR36**: Store managers can manually adjust batch quantities for corrections (damage, theft, count errors) with reason documentation.

**FR37**: Inventory adjustments create audit records with: batch_id, adjustment_quantity, reason, notes, user_id, timestamp.

**FR38**: Store managers can initiate weekly stock counts that snapshot current inventory quantities as baseline.

**FR39**: During stock counts, staff enter actual physical counts for each product with variance calculation (actual - expected).

**FR40**: Stock count review screen shows all variances with high-variance items (>10% or >10 units) flagged for attention.

**FR41**: Managers can add notes to variance items before finalizing stock count.

**FR42**: Finalizing stock count creates inventory adjustments for all variances and updates batch quantities.

**FR43**: Stock count history tracks all completed counts with variance trends over time.

**FR44**: System displays reminders when >7 days have passed since last stock count.

**FR45**: Managers can perform cycle counts on specific categories or products independently of weekly full counts.

**FR46**: **Sales by Product Category Report** displays revenue, units sold, and average transaction value by category with pie chart and bar chart visualizations.

**FR49**: **Top Products Report** ranks products by revenue, units sold, or transaction frequency with configurable top N display.

**FR50**: **Inventory Valuation Report** calculates total inventory value using FIFO cost basis across all active batches.

**FR51**: **Low Stock Alert Report** consolidates all products below reorder threshold with suggested reorder quantities.

**FR52**: **Inventory Movement Report** tracks all receipts, sales, and adjustments with shrinkage analysis by reason.

**FR53**: **Cashier Performance Report** evaluates individual cashier metrics including revenue, transaction count, average transaction value, and shift variances.

**FR54**: **Multi-Location Dashboard** compares performance across all locations with revenue rankings and health indicators.

**FR55**: All reports support date range filtering, location filtering, CSV export, and drill-down to transaction details.

**FR56**: Report hub displays all available reports with search/filter, recently viewed, and favorites functionality.

**FR57**: The system tracks batch expiration dates (optional field) and excludes expired batches from FIFO allocation.

**FR58**: Tier pricing applies only to products with category = "Flower"; other products use base_price.

**FR59**: Mixed carts correctly calculate totals: (flower items at tier price) + (non-flower items at base price).

**FR60**: Real-time shift summary dashboard displays: current shift status, transaction count, total revenue, expected cash, time remaining.

**FR61**: Navigation menu includes: POS, Products, Inventory, Shifts, Reports, Dashboard with responsive collapse on mobile.

**FR62**: All forms use React Hook Form + Zod schema validation with clear error messages.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a monorepo structure with all frontend code, configuration, and documentation in a single repository. This simplifies dependency management, enables atomic commits across the stack, and reduces context switching for AI agent development.

**Repository structure**:
```
/
âââ src/                    # React application source
âââ supabase/               # Database migrations and config
â   âââ migrations/         # SQL migration files
âââ public/                 # Static assets
âââ docs/                   # Project documentation (PRD, architecture)
âââ tests/                  # Test files (unit, integration)
âââ .env.example            # Environment variable template
âââ package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
```

### Service Architecture: Client-side SPA + Managed Backend (Supabase)

**Architecture Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with managed backend services

- **Frontend**: React 18+ SPA served as static files from Vercel CDN
- **Backend**: Supabase managed services (PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage, Real-time)
- **API Layer**: Supabase auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs with client SDK
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Row-Level Security (RLS) for authorization
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for inventory updates and shift dashboards
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for product images (if needed post-MVP)

**Rationale**: Managed backend eliminates server infrastructure complexity, auto-scales, provides built-in security (RLS), and fits 12-week timeline. SPA architecture supports offline-first capabilities (future enhancement) and fast client-side routing.

### Testing Strategy: Unit + Integration Testing

**Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests, manual UAT for end-to-end validation

**Testing Scope**:
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic functions (tier pricing calculation, FIFO allocation algorithm, validation rules, currency/weight formatting)
- **Component Tests**: React components in isolation (Cart, Product Search, Shift Reconciliation forms) with mocked Supabase client
- **Integration Tests**: Supabase client integration, API calls, database queries (using test database)
- **Manual UAT**: End-to-end user journeys (POS transaction, shift reconciliation, stock count) performed by pilot users and QA

**Test Coverage Target**: >70% for critical business logic, lower priority for UI-only components

**CI/CD Integration**: Tests run automatically on pull requests via GitHub Actions, blocking merge on failure

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

Throughout the development process, the following technical assumptions and requests apply:

1. **All sensitive keys and credentials** (Supabase URL, anon key, service role key) must be stored in `.env` files and documented in `.env.example`. Never commit actual keys to version control.

2. **Database migrations** must be written as SQL files in `/supabase/migrations` directory and versioned sequentially (e.g., `20250110120000_create_products_table.sql`). All schema changes go through migrations, never manual DB edits.

3. **RLS policies** must be defined for every table, even if the policy is permissive during development. Policies should follow least-privilege principle (users only access their location's data).

4. **Offline handling**: While offline-first is not an MVP requirement, error states must gracefully handle network failures with clear user messaging and retry mechanisms.

5. **Performance budget**: Initial bundle size should be <500KB gzipped. Use code splitting for routes and large dependencies (charts, PDF generation).

6. **Accessibility testing**: Run automated axe DevTools audits on all major screens. Manual screen reader testing (NVDA or VoiceOver) on critical flows (POS transaction, shift reconciliation).

7. **Browser compatibility**: Target last 2 versions of Chrome, Safari, Edge. No IE11 support required.

8. **Mobile performance**: Test on real devices (iPad, Android tablet) not just browser DevTools responsive mode.

9. **Security headers**: Configure Vercel to send appropriate security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS).

10. **Logging strategy**: Use structured logging (JSON format) for easier parsing. Log levels: error (production), warn (production), info (dev), debug (dev only).
