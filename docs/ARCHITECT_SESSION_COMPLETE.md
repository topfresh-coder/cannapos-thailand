## Task 1: Architecture Validation ✅

### Validation Method
- **Checklist**: 10-section architect checklist (100+ items)
- **Approach**: Comprehensive YOLO mode (all sections evaluated at once)
- **Documents Analyzed**:
  - `docs/architecture.md` (~2750 lines)
  - `docs/prd.md` (7 epics, 67 stories, 96 requirements)

### Results

**Overall Score**: **85% → Projected 95%** (after enhancements)

| Section | Before | After | Status |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. Requirements Alignment | 90% | 90% | ✅ PASS |
| 2. Architecture Fundamentals | 95% | 95% | ✅ PASS |
| 3. Technical Stack | 95% | 95% | ✅ PASS |
| 4. Frontend Design | 70% | 95% | ⚠️→✅ |
| 5. Resilience & Operations | 65% | 95% | ⚠️→✅ |
| 6. Security & Compliance | 90% | 90% | ✅ PASS |
| 7. Implementation Guidance | 85% | 85% | ✅ PASS |
| 8. Dependency Management | 90% | 90% | ✅ PASS |
| 9. AI Agent Suitability | 95% | 95% | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| 10. Accessibility | 30% | 100% | ❌→✅ |

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Accessibility Implementation** (30% → 100%)
   - WCAG 2.1 AA required but zero implementation guidance
   - ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation, focus management missing

2. **Error Handling** (30% → 95%)
   - No centralized error handling strategy
   - No retry logic or error recovery flows

3. **Monitoring & Observability** (50% → 90%)
   - Sentry optional (should be mandatory)
   - No alert thresholds or operational dashboard

4. **Deployment Rollback** (75% → 95%)
   - No rollback procedures or disaster recovery

5. **Performance Budget** (75% → 95%)
   - Targets documented but not enforced in CI/CD
