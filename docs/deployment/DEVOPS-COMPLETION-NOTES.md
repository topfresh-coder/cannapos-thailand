## Technical Insights from Context7

### Vercel Insights

1. **Monorepo Support**:
   - Vercel supports monorepos via `Root Directory` setting
   - Must point to deployable app location (`apps/web`)
   - Build commands execute within that directory

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set via dashboard or CLI: `vercel env add`
   - Can apply to specific environments
   - Accessible in build process and runtime

3. **Build Process**:
   - Vercel clones repository
   - Runs install command (`pnpm install`)
   - Executes build command (`pnpm run build`)
   - Deploys output directory (`dist/`)

4. **Automatic Deployments**:
   - Git integration enables auto-deployments
   - Main branch â†’ Production
   - Other branches â†’ Preview deployments
   - PRs get unique preview URLs

### Vite Insights

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Must start with `VITE_` prefix for client-side
   - Accessible via `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
   - Loaded from `.env` files based on mode
   - Can use `loadEnv()` in `vite.config.ts`

2. **Production Build**:
   - Command: `vite build`
   - Output: `dist/` directory
   - Minification: esbuild (default, faster) or terser
   - Source maps optional (disabled for faster builds)

3. **Optimization**:
   - Manual chunks for vendor code splitting
   - Rollup options for advanced configuration
   - Target: esnext for modern browsers
   - Tree-shaking removes unused code

4. **SPA Routing**:
   - Requires rewrite rules for client-side routing
   - All routes â†’ `index.html`
   - Configured via `vercel.json` or platform settings

**Dependency**: Production URL required for Playwright testing

**Cannot Proceed With**:
- Automated browser testing
- Production URL verification
- Screenshot capture
- Console error analysis
- Supabase connection testing
- Final test report creation

**Can Proceed When**: User provides production URL and confirms manual testing passed

### No Technical Blockers

## Risk Assessment

### Deployment Risks (Documented in Guide)

1. **Build Timeout** (Free plan: 45 seconds)
   - Mitigation: Current build is simple, should complete in time
   - Fallback: Upgrade to Pro plan if needed

2. **Environment Variables Missing**
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation with exact values
   - Detection: Console errors will show immediately
   - Resolution: Add variables and redeploy

3. **Monorepo Configuration Error**
   - Mitigation: Explicit instructions for Root Directory setting
   - Detection: Build will fail if wrong directory
   - Resolution: Update Root Directory to `apps/web`

4. **pnpm Not Used**
   - Mitigation: Documented need to set Install Command
   - Detection: Build may fail or use wrong packages
   - Resolution: Set Install Command to `pnpm install`

### Testing Risks

1. **Browser Installation Failure**
   - Low risk: Playwright MCP handles installation
   - Mitigation: Documented retry procedure

2. **Page Load Timeout**
   - Medium risk: Depends on Vercel server response
   - Mitigation: Retry logic documented

3. **Unexpected Console Errors**
   - Medium risk: Production environment may differ
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive error analysis documented

   - Ensure VITE_ prefix is present
   - Apply to all three environments

4. **Manual Testing Before Notification**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for errors before notifying DevOps
   - Test basic interactions

### For DevOps (Future Deployments)

1. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Automate Playwright testing on deployment
   - Run tests automatically after Vercel deploy
   - Post results as PR comment

2. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Enable Vercel Analytics
   - Configure error tracking (Sentry)
   - Set up uptime monitoring

3. **Document Production URL**:
