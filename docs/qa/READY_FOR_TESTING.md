# Authentication System - Ready for QA Testing

**Date:** 2025-10-13 05:50 GMT+7
**Developer:** React Frontend Architect
**Story:** 1.3 Authentication System
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING → RESOLVED
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR QA RE-TEST

---

## Quick Start for QA

### Test Server Running
- **URL:** http://localhost:5175
- **Status:** ✅ Running (Vite dev server)
- **Port:** 5175 (5173 and 5174 were in use)

### What to Test
1. **Login flow** - Fresh browser, login, verify navigation to /pos
2. **Session persistence** - Refresh page, verify session maintained
3. **localStorage** - Check for Supabase session keys

### Expected Timeline
- Login: 1-2 seconds from "Sign In" click to POS page
- Refresh: < 1 second to restore session
- No timeouts, no infinite loading states

---

## What Was Broken

### Issue #1: Login Stuck in Infinite "Loading..." State
**Symptom:** After successful Supabase authentication, page remained frozen showing "Loading..." with no navigation.

**Root Cause:** Race condition in `AuthContext.tsx` where `setLoading(false)` was called **immediately** after the API call, before the `onAuthStateChange` event could fire and set the user profile.

**Fix:** Removed premature `setLoading(false)` from `handleSignIn()`. The `onAuthStateChange` listener now controls loading state after fetching the user profile.

---

### Issue #2: Session Persistence Failed After Refresh
**Symptom:** Page refresh showed "Verifying authentication..." for 5 seconds, then timed out and redirected to login.

**Root Cause:** Same race condition - timeout was being hit because the auth flow wasn't completing properly.

**Fix:** With the race condition resolved, `getSession()` now properly restores the session from localStorage and completes in < 1 second.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. `apps/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (PRIMARY FIX)
**Lines Modified:** 46-201

**Key Changes:**
- **REMOVED** `finally` block from `handleSignIn()` that was setting `loading=false` too early
- **REMOVED** `finally` block from `handleSignOut()` (same issue)
- **ADDED** `isTimedOut` flag to prevent timeout conflicts
- **ADDED** comprehensive debug logging with `[AuthContext]` prefix
- **ADDED** timeout state tracking to prevent race conditions

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const handleSignIn = async (email: string, password: string): Promise<void> => {
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    await authSignIn(email, password);
  } catch (error) {
    setLoading(false);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    setLoading(false); // ❌ BUG: Always runs, sets loading=false too early
  }
};
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const handleSignIn = async (email: string, password: string): Promise<void> => {
  console.log('[AuthContext] handleSignIn called for email:', email);
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    await authSignIn(email, password);
    // DO NOT set loading=false here - let onAuthStateChange handle it ✅
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[AuthContext] authSignIn failed:', error);
    setLoading(false); // Only set loading=false on ERROR
    throw error;
  }
};
```

---

### 2. `apps/web/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` (DEBUG LOGGING)
**Lines Modified:** 60-103

**Key Changes:**
- **ADDED** debug logging to trace auth state changes
- **ADDED** logging for navigation events
- **ADDED** logging for form submission

**Purpose:** Allows QA to see exactly when LoginPage receives auth state updates and when navigation occurs.

---

### 3. `apps/web/src/services/auth.service.ts` (DEBUG LOGGING)
**Lines Modified:** 28-128

**Key Changes:**
- **ADDED** debug logging to `signIn()` function
- **ADDED** debug logging to `getUserProfile()` function
- **ADDED** logging for all Supabase API calls

**Purpose:** Allows QA to trace the full authentication API flow and identify where failures occur.

---

### 4. `apps/web/src/lib/supabase.ts` (DEBUG MODE)
**Lines Modified:** 70-96

**Key Changes:**
- **ADDED** `debug: true` to Supabase client auth config
- **ADDED** localStorage inspection on module load
- **ADDED** logging for client initialization

**Purpose:** Enables Supabase's built-in debug logging and allows QA to verify session persistence.

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Fresh Login (2 minutes)

**Pre-condition:** Fresh browser session (no cached auth)

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools console (F12)
2. Run `localStorage.clear()` in console
3. Navigate to http://localhost:5175/login
4. Open Network tab (to see API calls)
5. Enter test credentials:
   - Email: `manager@mainst.com`
   - Password: `Manager123!`
6. Click "Sign In"
7. Observe console output

**Expected Result:**
- Console shows step-by-step debug logs
- Network tab shows POST to `/auth/v1/token` (200 OK)
- Network tab shows SELECT query to `/rest/v1/users` (200 OK)
- Page navigates to `/pos` within 1-2 seconds
- User profile visible in header

**PASS Criteria:**
- ✅ No infinite "Loading..." state
- ✅ Navigation completes in < 3 seconds
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ Console shows `[LoginPage] Navigating to /pos`

**FAIL Criteria:**
- ❌ Page stuck showing "Loading..." for > 3 seconds
- ❌ Console warning: "Auth verification timeout"
- ❌ No navigation occurs
- ❌ Console errors

---

### Test 2: Session Persistence (1 minute)

**Pre-condition:** Test 1 completed successfully, user on `/pos` page

**Steps:**
1. Ensure you're on http://localhost:5175/pos
2. Note the user profile in header
3. Press F5 or Ctrl+R to refresh page
4. Observe console output

**Expected Result:**
- Brief spinner showing "Verifying authentication..." (< 1 second)
- Console shows `[AuthContext] getSession result: { hasSession: true }`
- Console shows `[AuthContext] Session found, fetching user profile...`
- Page loads normally, stays on `/pos`
- User profile still visible in header

**PASS Criteria:**
- ✅ Session restored in < 1 second
- ✅ No redirect to `/login`
- ✅ No timeout warning in console
- ✅ User profile data persists

**FAIL Criteria:**
- ❌ "Verifying authentication..." shows for > 1 second
- ❌ Console warning: "Auth verification timeout (5s)"
- ❌ Page redirects to `/login`
- ❌ Session lost

---

### Test 3: localStorage Inspection (30 seconds)

**Pre-condition:** Test 1 completed successfully

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools Application tab
2. Navigate to Storage > Local Storage
3. Click on http://localhost:5175
4. Look for key starting with `sb-cqbjcxbumucgohfhebdq-auth-token`
5. Inspect the value

**Expected Result:**
- Key exists with format: `sb-<project-ref>-auth-token`
- Value is valid JSON containing:
  - `access_token` (JWT string)
  - `refresh_token` (string)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp)
  - `user` (object with id, email, etc.)

**PASS Criteria:**
- ✅ Supabase auth key exists in localStorage
- ✅ Value is valid JSON
- ✅ Contains access_token and refresh_token

**FAIL Criteria:**
- ❌ No Supabase key in localStorage
- ❌ Key exists but value is empty/null
- ❌ Value is not valid JSON

## Architecture Notes

### Why This Fix Works

The fix implements **event-driven state management** where:

1. **Single Source of Truth:** The `onAuthStateChange` listener is the only place that sets `loading=false` after successful auth operations
2. **No Race Conditions:** Auth operations don't compete with the listener to update state
3. **Predictable Flow:** State changes happen in a deterministic order
4. **Error Handling:** Only errors cause immediate `loading=false`, success waits for event

### Key Patterns Applied

1. **Listener Pattern:** `onAuthStateChange` centralizes auth state management
2. **Async State Coordination:** Loading state tied to data fetching completion
3. **Timeout Safety Net:** 5-second timeout prevents infinite loading
4. **Debug Observability:** Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
