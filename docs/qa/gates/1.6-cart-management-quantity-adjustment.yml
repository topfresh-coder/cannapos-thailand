  maintainability:
    status: PASS

final_notes: |
  This story demonstrates exemplary quality engineering practices:

  1. **Test-Driven Validation**: 159 comprehensive tests covering all 8 acceptance criteria
  2. **Accessibility First**: 14 dedicated accessibility tests ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  3. **Proper Error Handling**: Validation errors, loading states, and inventory checks all tested
  4. **Performance Conscious**: Debounced input, optimistic UI, and bundle size monitoring
  5. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns (UI, state, validation)

  The Dev agent's QA remediation work was outstanding - all 27 failing tests fixed,
  2 new comprehensive test files created, and 1 implementation bug discovered and fixed.

  **Quality Score: 100/100** - Zero issues remaining. Story ready for production deployment.
