  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Excellent security implementation:

      - 27 comprehensive RLS policies with role-based access control
      - JWT-based authentication via auth.uid()
      - Location isolation for multi-tenant security
      - Helper functions (current_user_role, current_user_location) properly marked as STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
      - Audit trail protection (INSERT-only policies on transactions and inventory_adjustments)

test_coverage_analysis:
  status: NO_UNIT_TESTS_REQUIRED
  rationale: |
    Story 1.2 is infrastructure/schema setup with no business logic requiring unit tests.
    Testing strategy (from story Dev Notes):
    - Manual Testing: Schema creation verified by successful migration execution
    - RLS Policy Testing: Manual testing with different user roles in Supabase SQL Editor
    - Health Check: Functional testing after migrations run
    - Future Stories: Will add integration tests using this schema

  Gate Status: CONCERNS (not PASS)

  The implementation quality is EXCELLENT across all dimensions:
  - Security: 10/10 (comprehensive RLS with 27 policies)
  - Performance: 9/10 (13 strategic indexes)
  - Reliability: 9/10 (robust error handling)
  - Maintainability: 10/10 (excellent documentation)

  However, CONCERNS status is assigned due to:

  1. **Manual Tasks Required (Medium Severity)**
     - AC1 cannot be completed without user creating Supabase account
     - Tasks 1, 2, 9 require external service interaction
     - Mitigation: Comprehensive step-by-step guide provided

  2. **Stale Migration File (Low Severity)**
     - 20250110000001_initial_schema.sql exists but undocumented
     - May cause confusion about active migrations
     - Mitigation: Quick fix - remove or document

  3. **Placeholder Types (Low Severity)**
     - supabase.ts has incorrect placeholder types
     - Will be replaced when user runs type generation
     - Mitigation: Instructions clear in file comments

  **Recommendation: READY FOR DONE after user completes manual tasks**

  All automated development work is production-ready. The CONCERNS status
  reflects external dependencies (Supabase account, CLI) rather than code quality.
  Once user executes manual tasks 1, 2, and 9, story is COMPLETE.

  Quality Score: 80/100 (GOOD - manual tasks prevent perfect score)
