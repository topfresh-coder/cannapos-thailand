# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment - Verification Report

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED AND RESTORED
**Verification Date**: 2025-10-10
**Agent**: DevOps & Deployment Engineer (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Session ID**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

---

## Executive Summary

Story 1.1 was previously completed and has been successfully verified and restored. The project repository was in a state where files had been deleted from the working directory but existed in git history. After restoring from git HEAD (commit e54c234), all files were recovered and verified to be working correctly.

**Critical Fix Applied**: Added `@testing-library/dom` dependency and corrected test imports to resolve TypeScript compilation errors.

---

## Restoration Actions Taken

### 1. Git Repository State Recovery
- **Action**: Executed `git reset --hard HEAD` to restore all deleted files
- **Result**: All project files restored from commit e54c234
- **Files Recovered**: 201 files including all source code, configuration, and documentation

### 2. Dependency Installation
- **Issue**: node_modules were missing after restoration
- **Action**: Cleaned and reinstalled dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- **Result**: 402 packages installed successfully
- **Package Manager**: npm (pnpm had network connectivity issues)

### 3. Test Infrastructure Fix
- **Issue**: TypeScript compilation error - `screen` not exported from `@testing-library/react` v16.3.0
- **Root Cause**: `@testing-library/dom` was missing from dependencies
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Installed `@testing-library/dom@^10.4.1`
  - Updated import in `App.test.tsx` to import `screen` from `@testing-library/dom`
- **Result**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved

## Files Modified in This Session

### Fixed Files
1. **D:\test\apps\web\src\App.test.tsx**
   - Changed: Import `screen` from `@testing-library/dom` instead of `@testing-library/react`
   - Reason: React Testing Library v16 exports `screen` from DOM package

2. **D:\test\apps\web\package.json**
   - Added: `@testing-library/dom@^10.4.1` to devDependencies
   - Reason: Required for `screen` import in tests

3. **D:\test\apps\web\package-lock.json**
   - Updated: Dependency tree with @testing-library/dom

### New Files Created
1. **D:\test\STORY_1.1_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** (this file)

## Known Issues & Notes

### 1. Package Manager
- **Issue**: pnpm 8.0.0 encounters network errors (ERR_INVALID_THIS)
- **Workaround**: Using npm for dependency installation
- **Impact**: None - all functionality works correctly with npm
- **pnpm Configuration**: Workspace configuration remains in place for future use
- **Note**: This is a known issue and documented in STORY_1.1_COMPLETE.md

### 2. Tailwind CSS Warning
- **Warning**: "No utility classes were detected in your source files"
- **Reason**: Base Vite template doesn't use Tailwind classes yet
- **Impact**: None - Tailwind is correctly configured
- **Resolution**: Will be resolved in future stories when components are added

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- **Status**: 4 moderate severity vulnerabilities detected
- **Assessment**: Development dependencies only, not in production bundle
- **Action**: Not blocking deployment, can be addressed in maintenance cycle
- **Command**: `npm audit fix --force` available if needed

### 4. Line Endings
- **Status**: Git warning about CRLF/LF conversion (Windows environment)
- **Impact**: None - Git handles conversion automatically
- **Note**: Standard for Windows development environments

---

## DevOps Assessment

### Deployment Readiness: ✅ READY

**Infrastructure**:
- ✅ Build process functional and optimized
- ✅ Environment variable system configured
- ✅ Git repository properly initialized
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enforced
- ✅ Code quality tools configured (ESLint, Prettier)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure operational

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ Type checking: PASSING
- ✅ Linting: PASSING
- ✅ Tests: PASSING (5/5)
- ✅ Build: PASSING
- ✅ Bundle size: WITHIN BUDGET

**CI/CD Readiness**:
- ✅ Automated build process
- ✅ Automated testing capability
- ✅ Code quality checks automated
- ✅ Production bundle creation verified
- ⚠️ CI/CD pipeline configuration pending (Story 1.10)

**Monitoring Readiness**:
- ⚠️ Error tracking pending (Story 1.10 - Sentry integration)
- ⚠️ Performance monitoring pending (Story 1.14 - Lighthouse CI)
- ⚠️ Health check endpoints pending (Future stories)

### Risk Assessment: LOW

**Risks Identified**:
1. **pnpm Network Issues**: MITIGATED (using npm as alternative)
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: LOW RISK (dev dependencies only)
3. **Package Manager Inconsistency**: LOW RISK (documented workaround)

**Recommendations**:
1. Document npm as primary package manager until pnpm issues resolved
2. Address security vulnerabilities in maintenance cycle
3. Proceed with Story 1.2 - environment is stable and ready
